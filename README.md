# NextJS Chatbot with OpenAI API

This is a README file for a Chatbot project built using NextJS and the OpenAI API. The project is currently 20% complete and aims to create an interactive chatbot that utilizes the power of the OpenAI language model to provide intelligent responses to user queries.

## Project Overview

The NextJS Chatbot with OpenAI API project leverages NextJS, a popular React framework for server-rendered applications, to build a user interface for the chatbot. The chatbot's core functionality will be implemented using the OpenAI API, which allows for natural language processing and generation of human-like text.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```shell
   cd nextjs-chatbot
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using a package manager like npm or yarn.
   ```shell
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Create an account on the OpenAI platform and obtain an API key.

5. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key as follows:
   ```shell
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

6. Start the development server.
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

7. Access the chatbot application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

The chatbot's functionality will be developed incrementally as the project progresses. Currently, it supports basic user queries and generates responses using the OpenAI API. The UI allows users to enter their queries and view the chatbot's responses in real-time.

As the project evolves, additional features such as context handling, conversation history, and personalized responses will be implemented.
